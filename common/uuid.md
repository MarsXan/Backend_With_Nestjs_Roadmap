using UUID for the id field is perfectly fine and commonly used in modern applications. UUIDs offer several advantages:
```Typescript
@Entity()
export class User {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn('uuid')
    id: string;
}
```
## Advantages of using UUID:
- Global Uniqueness: UUIDs are unique across systems, making them suitable when you need unique identifiers that don't clash, even across distributed databases.
- Security: UUIDs are harder to guess compared to sequential numeric IDs, which could help mitigate certain security risks, like enumeration attacks.
- Decoupling: Using UUIDs can decouple the database layer from business logic, as the generation of UUIDs doesn't rely on the database, and they can be created at the application level.

## Potential Trade-offs:
- Storage: UUIDs are larger (128 bits or 16 bytes) than typical integers, which could slightly increase storage space, but this is usually not significant unless dealing with very large datasets.
- Index Performance: UUIDs are not sequential like auto-incrementing IDs, which can lead to slightly slower indexing performance in large databases. However, this can be mitigated with certain optimizations if necessary.
