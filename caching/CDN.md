# CDN
A CDN, or Content Delivery Network, is a system of servers spread out across the globe that helps deliver content (like images, videos, CSS, JavaScript files) to users faster and more reliably. When someone visits a website, instead of loading all the content from a single server (which can be slow if the server is far away from them), the CDN delivers content from the server closest to the user. This reduces the time it takes to load the website.

## Why a CDN is Useful:
- Faster Loading Times: By using servers closer to the user, the content loads quicker.
- Reliability: If one server has an issue, the CDN can still serve content from another, reducing downtime.
- Scalability: A CDN can handle high traffic by spreading it across multiple servers.
- Security: Many CDNs offer added security features, like protection against DDoS attacks.
## Key Points to Remember:
- Caching: CDNs store copies of content in multiple locations, so itâ€™s "cached" for faster access.
- Edge Servers: These are the servers in the CDN network, placed in various locations worldwide.
- Types of Content: CDNs work for static content (images, CSS) but can also help optimize dynamic content (user-specific data, like account info).

Using a CDN is especially helpful if you want to reach a global audience or improve the performance and reliability of a high-traffic website.
